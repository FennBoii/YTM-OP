# YTM-OP
## This project is a self project meaning this is mostly just for me but your allowed to do whatever you wish with this project if you come across it.</center>


*Summary: "This is a Youtube Music Client with a Discord Rich Presence and janky VRChat OSC support and only if you know how to run it"*

***To do:***
- Fix project so when u 'npm install' it doesn't break and say some vc++ error
- Make everything look neater with a better menu and cleaner look
- Allow the titlebar to be customized through text in textfiles for untimate customization
    - If you've got any ideas, leave them somewhere maybe in issued idk I'll *most-likely* add them
