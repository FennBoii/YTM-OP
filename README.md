*Summary: "This is a Youtube Music Client with a Discord Rich Presence and janky VRChat OSC support and only if you know how to run i








- ~~Fix project so when u 'npm install' it doesn't break and say some vc++ error~~
- ~~Fix "win-audio" package because it keeps making the builds fail (currently is broken with current build, the "System Volume" is stuck at '78%')~~
- ~~Fix Restart and Shutdown~~
- Update all the old packages
- External Files Setup
- <s>Add Releases so you can just get a distribution player instead of a whole package you need to compile yourself everytime</s>
- Make everything look neater with a better menu and cleaner look
- Allow the titlebar to be customized through text in textfiles for ultimate customization
    - If you've got any ideas, leave them somewhere maybe in issues idk I'll *definitely* add them
- Try to add releases for Mac and Linux in the future when I get the time
- Add SENDING and RECIEVING for when you want to remotely play music through clients (the basics are already in the client just doesn't do anything yet)
- Add a function to be able to add your own discord activity through a text file for the clientID and also maybe images

***Features***
- Added a feature that allows the client to act a little like spotify in the sense that it disconnects when your song is paused and connects when its playing.. I haven't really tested this fully but it works for now. It's called "Not Playing Disconnect" in the Utils.
- Allows you to enable and disable discord buttons (Still kinda janky)
- Has options for "Quitting the application", "Sleeping your PC", "Restarting your PC", and "Shutting down your PC" after the song ends.

- *If you find that a video doesn't work for the activity on discord, or shows 'undefined', you can open the Utils menu and click on buttons and turn the buttons off. If that doesn't work you can click on buttons once again and click on the 'toggle channel'. (toggling channel just makes the element which gets the artist, change). These methods should fix any video problems you may have with the activity. Remember, when watching a video or a song without an album accompanying it or the artist doesn't have a clickable link to their page, you can toggle all buttons off. This disables the elemets which get the buttons and usually fixes things. Sometimes when playing videos though the artist does have a clickable link and in that case just toggle the artist. Simple!*

- Continuous updates (Its not daily but its also not monthly)
- **In the works** Youll be able to Send and recieve functionality between clients
- 100% safe and free! No extras are added that weren't made for the client
- Uses very little Resources (Less than 7% of cpu) (reccomended use on localdisk C:// because read/write)
- No self promotion anywhere (I like to let the consumer use the product however the please, ad-free!)
