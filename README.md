**Token site is now under 24/7 surveilence with text messages and auto-restart processes incase of wifi issues, hardware issues, etc.. we should be good for now and on!*

<h3>Important Note</h3>
-Run the player as Admin ALWAYS; Needed simply for write perms.

**more "advanced / future" updates! (difficulty low (top) to hard (bottom)**
- Interaction with the windows audio banner (so when u click it it opens the YTM client)
- I've got to make a custom load settings screen to modify everything in real time (will take time to develop)
- Notifications!
- Setup Chrome cast (somehow, may take some time)
- (maybe) Just a title in the taskbar with the name of the song instead of the whole application's square?

<b>THERE MAY BE ERRORS WHEN CLOSING AND MAYBE SOME DURING, I AM WORKING ON THESE JUST RESTART THE CLIENT OR ADD THE ISSUES TO "ISSUES" TAB</b>

# YTM-OP
## This project is a self project meaning this is mostly just for me but your allowed to do whatever you wish with this project if you come across it.</center>

* Summary: "This is a Youtube Music Client with a lot of built in features (adding VRC OSC again natively, soon)"

<hr />
<center><h2>How to setup client syncing</h2></center>
- Launch the player (make sure its running with Administrator (your keys cannot be inserted if not) and once its connected to discord, click on Utils > Sites > Go to YTM-OP site. Discord will disconnect.
- Once there, put ANY name in and generate those keys! Then once that page loads, use the bottom button and it'll insert them for you automatically.
- Now that the config.json gets updated live, your able to use them without restarting the client! Just use the menu! Utils > Incoming Connections > sending or receiving! Clikc on <b>Edit Config</b> for live editing!
- Know that everytime you put a name into the site the random token WILL be reset but the other keys will be left the same. Also, still on the site your able to click and copy all the keys to send and soon, ill make all of this a url and itll do it all auto with just a simple link!

<b>more "advanced / future" updates! (difficulty low (top) to hard (bottom)</b>
- Make everything look neater with a better menu and cleaner look
- Allow the titlebar to be customized through text in textfiles for ultimate customization
    - If you've got any ideas, leave them somewhere maybe in issues idk I'll *definitely* add them
- Try to add releases for Mac and Linux in the future when I get the time (Currently working on a release for linux)

***Features***
- Just download the Installer from the download page and run it, It's quite simple!
- Your able to automatically disconnect and reconnect the discord activity whether your music is paused or it's playing! In the menu  this framework is called "notPlayingDisconnect"!
- Allows you to enable and disable discord buttons
- You can now modify the alternate value of the buttons which are the default "Album" and "Artist"! Toggle it in the Utils > Buttons > ChangeButtonsAlb/Art!
- Has options for "Quitting the application", "Sleeping your PC", "Restarting your PC", and "Shutting down your PC" after the song ends.
- Your able to Send and receive functionally between clients (bascially like spotify)!
- Continuous updates (Its not daily but its also not monthly)
- 100% safe and free! No extras are added that weren't made for the client
- Uses very little Resources (Less than 13% of cpu when low disk space) (recommended use on localdisk C:// because read/write)
- No self promotion anywhere (I like to let the consumer use the product however they please, ad-free!)
