*Summary: "This is a Youtube Music Client with a Discord Rich Presence and janky VRChat OSC support and only if you know how to run it"*

***To do: (In the next few days)***
- Fix project so when u 'npm install' it doesn't break and say some vc++ error
- Fix "win-audio" package because it keeps making the builds fail (currently is broken with current build, the "System Volume" is stuck at '78%')
- Fix Restart and Shutdown 
- External Files Setup
- <s>Add Releases so you can just get a distribution player instead of a whole package you need to compile yourself everytime</s>
- Make everything look neater with a better menu and cleaner look
- Allow the titlebar to be customized through text in textfiles for untimate customization
    - If you've got any ideas, leave them somewhere maybe in issues idk I'll *definitely* add them
- Try to add releases for Mac and Linux in the future when I get the time
- Add SENDING and RECIEVING for when you want to remotely play music through clients (the basics are already in the client just doesn't do anything yet)
- Add a function to be able to add your own discord activity through a text file for the clientID and also maybe images

***Features***
- Allows you to enable and disable discord buttons (Still kinda janky)
- Has options for "Quitting the application", "Sleeping your PC", "Restarting your PC", and "Shutting down your PC" after the song ends.
- Continuous updates (Its not daily but its also not monthly)
- **In the works** Youll be able to Send and recieve functionality between clients
- 100% safe and free! No extras are added that weren't made for the client
- Uses very little Resources (Less than 7% of cpu) (reccomended use on localdisk C:// because read/write)
- No self promotion anywhere (I like to let the consumer use the product however the please, ad-free!)
